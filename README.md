## About the Project
Participants will be provided with Figma designs representing an interactive photo gallery for both desktop and mobile views. Their task is to translate these designs into a functional web application that meets specific requirements, including responsiveness, design accuracy, hover interactions, cross-browser compatibility, and code quality.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
* Git
*VS CODE or other IDEA 
* A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/Tuyishimes/COA-TASKFORCE.git
## How I made this Project
Within the HTML package, you'll find the `home.html` file, which serves as the central document for implementing the task outlined in the Figma designs. This HTML file contains all the necessary markup to create the interactive photo gallery as per the project requirements. It includes elements such as image tags, labels, and additional markup essential for the gallery's functionality. Moreover, the `home.html` file links to the `assets` folder, enabling access to images and other resources required for the gallery. Additionally, it establishes a connection to the `style.css` file for applying styles and ensuring a coherent visual presentation across the gallery.


## CSS Package

The CSS package is responsible for styling the HTML content, ensuring compatibility with the design requirements specified in the Figma designs and optimizing responsiveness for various devices. The primary file within this package is `style.css`, meticulously crafted to complement the HTML structure and achieve pixel-perfect alignment with the design guidelines. By employing best practices and incorporating media queries, the CSS stylesheets ensure seamless adaptability across different screen sizes and devices. Through careful consideration of layout, spacing, typography, and visual elements, the CSS package enhances the user experience and maintains consistency in design presentation across platforms. Additionally, the CSS rules prioritize clarity, readability, and maintainability, facilitating easy collaboration and future enhancements to the project.
## Assets Package

The Assets package houses all the necessary images and resources utilized within the project. Specifically, it contains a collection of images essential for populating the interactive photo gallery created in accordance with the Figma designs. These images are carefully selected to enhance the visual appeal of the gallery and provide users with an engaging browsing experience. By organizing images within the Assets package, the project maintains a structured and centralized repository, facilitating easy access and management of resources. This ensures seamless integration of visuals into the HTML content and enables efficient loading of images across different devices and screen sizes, contributing to the overall responsiveness and performance of the web application.

##Coding Challenges explaintion
In completing the coding challenge, i utilized Javascript, as required. My primary Developemnt environment was VS code, which provifed a conductive workspace for writing and testing Javascript code. Vs code's build-in functionality facilitated the execution and testing of solution of the give challenges. 


##To run solutions:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website.
2. Open the JavaScript file containing the solutions in your preferred code editor, such as VS Code.
3. Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file.
4. Run the JavaScript file using Node.js by typing the command `node Name of file `, (Name of file ) replace with the name of the JavaScript file containing the solution with 'js'.
5. Review the output in the terminal or command prompt to see the results of the executed solution.
6. Remember to provide input in file solution.
